= Day 2: Introduction 
The second day of Technomorph, an 8-day interactive event organized by Robotics Club IOEPC was a little bit more interesting. Day 2 was  leaned more towards informative sessions as well as  engaging and practical activities while also keeping participants engaged through  activities that sparked curiosity and enthusiasm for robotics and programming.

On the second day, we explored programmable boards like Arduino, ESP32, and STM. The session covered their basic architectures, key features, and differences. We focused mainly on Arduino programming, learning how to use the Arduino IDE, upload code, and interact with hardware components. ESP32 was introduced for its Wi-Fi and Bluetooth capabilities, while STM boards were discussed for more advanced and industrial applications. The session gave us a clear understanding of how these boards work and how they are used in real-world projects.


We also got the opportunity to work with Tinkercad, a virtual simulation platform widely used for circuit design and Arduino programming. It allowed us to build and test circuits without physical components, making it easier to understand the logic and functionality behind each connection. This hands-on simulation experience made learning more interactive, accessible, and fun, especially for beginners exploring hardware concepts.
