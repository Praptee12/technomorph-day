= Day 1: Introduction 
The first day of Technomorph, an 8-day interactive event organized by Robotics Club IOEPC, kicked off today. Day 1 wasn’t exactly what I expected — it leaned more towards informative sessions rather than engaging activities. The session was led by Mr. Binam Shrestha, a passionate robotics learner and CEO of Utthan Robotics Lab. He shared his personal journey and valuable insights from his experience in the robotics field.

== -* Learning*
 
Our opening session focused on robots and robotics. It gave us a clear overview of what robotics is, covering both its foundation and real-world uses. Toward the end, we also explored tools for version control and documentation, including platforms like Git and GitHub.
